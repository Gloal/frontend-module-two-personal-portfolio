        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            When I am an old woman I shall wear purple With a red hat which
            doesn't go, and doesn't suit me. And I shall spend my pension on
            brandy and summer gloves And satin sandals, and say we've no money
            for butter. I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired And
            gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells And run my stick
            along the public railings And make up for the sobriety of my youth.
            I shall go out in my slippers in the rain And pick flowers in other
            people's gardens And learn to spit.
            <br />
            <br />You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat And eat three
            pounds of sausages at a go Or only bread and pickle for a week And
            hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes. But now we
            must have clothes that keep us dry And pay our rent and not swear in
            the street And set a good example for the children. We must have
            friends to dinner and read the papers.
            <br />
            <br />But maybe I ought to practice a little now? So people who know
            me are not too shocked and surprise When suddenly I am old, and
            start to wear purple <br />
            - Warning by Jenny Joseph, 1961.
