# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

# My Web-developer portfolio 

A potential portfolio website built using CSS and HTML to the acceptance criteria below.

# Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

# Website Details
Built with HTML and CSS. Special concentration paid to arranging blocks in a flex-grid pattern that will respond to screen size changes. 

Please note: The Work section includes projects I have worked on and projects I hope to be able to work on soon.
